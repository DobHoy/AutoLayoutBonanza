# AutoLayoutBonanza
AutoLayoutBonanza is not pretty -- it's intended as an exercise for the developer to see how the visual format works for AutoLayout and gives you, the developer, I'm talking to you, the chance to play around with it a little bit.

There are two `TODO` comments in the code for you to actively attack and see if you can't fix.
